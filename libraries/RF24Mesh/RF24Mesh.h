/**
 * @mainpage Mesh Networking Layer for RF24 Radios
 *
 * This class intends to provide a simple and seamless 'mesh' layer for sensor networks, allowing automatic and dynamic configuration
 * that can be customized to suit many scenarios. It is currently designed to interface directly with with the
 * <a href="http://tmrh20.github.com/RF24Network/">RF24Network Development library</a>, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer">OSI Network Layer</a> using nRF24L01(+) radios driven
 * by the newly optimized <a href="http://tmrh20.github.com/RF24/">RF24</a> library fork.
 *
 * @section Purpose Purpose/Goal
 *
 * Provide a simple user interface for creating dynamic sensor networks with the RF24 and RF24Network libraries.
 *
 *
 * <b>What works currently?</b>
 * @li Basic 'mesh' functionality using an <b>Arduino or RPi</b> as the master node which will generally receive the sensor data
 * @li Simple, dynamic addressing based on a pre-assigned unique identifier
 * @li Dynamic/On-the fly configuration of addresses and network topology
 *  
 * <b>What are the functional limitations?</b>
 * @li Address assignments are not saved, except on RPi/Linux devices. If the 'master' node goes down, all nodes need to reconnect to the mesh or restart to prevent addressing conflicts. 
 *
 *
 * @section Overview RF24Mesh Overview
 * The RF24Network library provides a system of addressing and routing for RF24 radio modules, that allows large wireless sensor networks to be constructed. RF24Mesh
 * provides extended features, including automatic addressing and dynamic configuration of wireless sensors. 
 * 
 * How does it work?
 * The 'master' node keeps track of the unique nodeIDs and the assigned RF24Network addresses. When a node is moved physically, or just loses its connection to the network,
 * it can be set to automatically re-join the mesh, and reconfigure itself within the network.
 *
 * Nodes are assigned a unique number ranging from 1 to 255, and just about everything else, addressing, routing, etc. is managed by the library.
 * 
 * In the 'mesh' configuration sensors/nodes can move around physically, far from the 'master node' using other nodes to route traffic over extended distances. Addressing and
 * topology can be reconfigured as connections are broken and re-established within different areas of the network.
 *

 *
 * @page Setup-Config Setup And Config
 *
 * The initial testing version of RF24Mesh is built as a simple overlay for RF24Network. Users currently need to be familiar with the basics of sending and receiving data via
 * RF24Network, but do not need to understand the topology, routing or addressing systems. RF24Mesh will attempt to construct and maintain a mesh network, keeping all nodes
 * connected together.
 *
 * @section Requirements Requirements
 * <b>Hardware Requirements:</b>  <br>
 * @li 1 Raspberry Pi or Arduino to act as the Master Node <br>
 * @li 1 or more Arduino,RPi,etc. (Sensor Nodes)  <br>
 * @li 1 or more NRF24L01+ radio modules  <br>
 * @li 1 or more various sensors for your sensor nodes  <br>
 *  
 * <b>Software Requirements:</b>
 * @li <a href="https://github.com/TMRh20/RF24/archive/master.zip">RF24 Core Radio Library</a>
 * @li <a href="https://github.com/TMRh20/RF24Network/archive/Development.zip">RF24Network Development Library</a>
 * @li <a href="https://github.com/TMRh20/RF24Mesh/archive/master.zip">RF24Mesh - Dynamic Mesh Library</a>
 *  
 * @section Installation Installation
 * 1. If not installed, download and install the RF24, RF24Network DEV, and RF24Mesh libraries per the above links  <br>
 *  <br>
 * 2. Configure and test the hardware using examples from RF24 and RF24Network prior to attempting to use RF24Mesh  <br>
 *    a: <b>In Arduino IDE:</b> File > Examples > RF24 > GettingStarted  <br>
 *    b: <b>RPi:</b> Follow the Quick-Start instructions on <a href="https://github.com/TMRh20/RF24Network/tree/Development/RPi">GitHub</a>  <br>
 *  <br>
 * 3. Once testing is complete:  <br>
 *    a: <b>Arduino IDE:</b> File > Examples > RF24Mesh > RF24Mesh_Example  <br>
 *    b: <b>RPi:</b> Run 'make' from the examples directory. Then 'sudo ./RF24Mesh_Example_Master' to begin as the master node   <br>
 *    <br>
 * 4. Once configured and running, the Master Node will begin to assign addresses to the sensor nodes, which will find their way onto the network, and
 *    display incoming data from the sensor examples. Usage is very much the same as RF24Network, except for address assignment and network management.  
 *
 * @section Config Configuration
 *
 * As per the examples, nodes are configured with a unique value between 1 and 255. This allows them to change positions on the network, while still being identified. <br>
 *
 * For pre-configuration of the mesh, only a few options are available by editing RF24Mesh_config.h prior to compiling: <br>
 * 
 * @code  
 * #define MESH_MAX_CHILDREN 4  
 * @endcode
 * The max_children option restricts the maximum number of child nodes/node and limits the number of available addresses on the network. Max: 4 <br>
 *
 * @code  
 * #define MESH_NOMASTER  
 * @endcode
 * The nomaster option reduces program space and memory usage. Can be used on any node except for the master (nodeID 0) <br>
 *
 * 
 * @li See <a href="General-Usage.html">General Usage</a> for information on how to work with the mesh once connected.
 * 
 * @page General-Usage General Usage
 * 
 * One thing to keep in mind is the dynamic nature of RF24Mesh, and the need to verify connectivity to the network. For nodes that are constantly transmitting,
 * (every few seconds at most) it is suitable to check the connection, and/or renew the address when connectivity fails. Since data is not saved by the master 
 * node, if the master node goes down, all child nodes must renew their address. In this case, as long as the master node is down for a few seconds, the nodes
 * will all begin requesting an address.  <br>
 *  
 * Nodes that are not actively transmitting, should be configured to test their connection at predefined intervals, to allow them to reconnect as necessary.<br>
 *  
 * In the case of sleeping nodes, or nodes that will only be online temporarily, it is generally suitable to release the address prior to going offline, and 
 * requesting an address upon waking. Keep in mind, address requests can generally take anywhere from 10-15ms, up to few seconds in most cases. <br>
 *   
 * One of the recently introduced features is the ability to transmit payloads without the network returning a network-ack response. If solely using this method
 * of transmission, the node should also be configured to verify its connection via mesh.checkConnection(); periodically, to ensure connectivity.
 *
 * Beyond requesting and releasing addresses, usage is as outlined in the RF24Network Development documentation at http://tmrh20.github.io
 *
